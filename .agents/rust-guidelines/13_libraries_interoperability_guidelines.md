# Libraries / Interoperability Guidelines



## Don't leak external types (M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES) { #M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES }

<why>stable APIs and low long-term maintenance cost.</why>

Where possible, you should prefer `std`<sup>1</sup> types in public APIs over types coming from external crates. Exceptions should be carefully considered.

Any type in any public API will become part of that API's contract. Since `std` and constituents are the only crates
shipped by default, and since they come with a permanent stability guarantee, their types are the only ones that come without an interoperability risk.

A crate that exposes another crate's type is said to _leak_ that type.

For maximal long term stability your crate should, theoretically, not leak any types. Practically, some leakage
is unavoidable, sometimes even beneficial. We recommend you follow this heuristic:

- [ ] if you can avoid it, do not leak third-party types
- [ ] if you are part of an umbrella crate,<sup>2</sup> you may freely leak types from sibling crates.
- [ ] behind a relevant feature flag, types may be leaked (e.g., `serde`)
- [ ] without a feature _only_ if they give a _substantial benefit_. Most commonly that is interoperability with significant
      other parts of the Rust ecosystem based around these types.

<sup>1</sup> In rare instances, e.g., high performance libraries used from embedded, you might even want to limit yourself to `core` only.

<sup>2</sup> For example, a `runtime` crate might be the umbrella of `runtime_rt`, `runtime_app` and `runtime_clock` As users are
expected to only interact with the umbrella, siblings may leak each others types.

## Native escape hatches (M-ESCAPE-HATCHES) { #M-ESCAPE-HATCHES }

<why>workarounds for unsupported use cases until alternatives exist.</why>

Types wrapping native handles should provide `unsafe` escape hatches. In interop scenarios your users might have gotten a native handle from somewhere
else, or they might have to pass your wrapped handle over FFI. To enable these use cases you should provide `unsafe` conversion methods.

```rust
# type HNATIVE = *const u8;
pub struct Handle(HNATIVE);

impl Handle {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        // Safely creates handle via API calls
        # todo!()
    }

    // Constructs a new Handle from a native handle the user got elsewhere.
    // This method  should then also document all safety requirements that
    // must be fulfilled.
    pub unsafe fn from_native(native: HNATIVE) -> Self {
        Self(native)
    }

    // Various extra methods to permanently or temporarily obtain
    // a native handle.
    pub fn into_native(self) -> HNATIVE { self.0 }
    pub fn to_native(&self) -> HNATIVE { self.0 }
}
```



## Items come from their original crate (M-FOREIGN-REEXPORTS) { #M-FOREIGN-REEXPORTS }

<why>unambiguous type identity.</why>

Crates should generally not re-export items from other crates. For example, if your crate contains a method `foo::download(url: bar::Url)`, you should not do `pub use bar::Url` from inside `foo`. This avoids having possibly dozens of aliases in context, which can get confusing for both users and agents, in particular if these are mixed with genuinely different types of the same name from other crates.

When a crate accepts or returns a type defined in some third-party crate, users are expected to depend on that third-party crate directly and import the type from there. That said, there are a few valid exceptions to this rule:

- Umbrella crates (compare [M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES](./#M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES)) by definition re-export other types
- Crates split for technical reasons (e.g., exporting `foo_core::Url` from `foo`)
- Macro use to provide stable paths, e.g., via some hidden `foo::__private::Url`



## Accept `impl AsRef<>` where feasible (M-IMPL-ASREF) { #M-IMPL-ASREF }

<why>flexibility for callers to use their own types.</why>

In **function** signatures, accept `impl AsRef<T>` for types that have a
[clear reference hierarchy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/convert/trait.AsRef.html#implementors), where you
do not need to take ownership, or where object creation is relatively cheap.

| Instead of ... | accept ... |
| --- | --- |
| `&str`, `String` | `impl AsRef<str>` |
| `&Path`, `PathBuf` | `impl AsRef<Path>` |
| `&[u8]`, `Vec<u8>` | `impl AsRef<[u8]>` |

```rust,ignore
# use std::path::Path;
// Definitely use `AsRef`, the function does not need ownership.
fn print(x: impl AsRef<str>) {}
fn read_file(x: impl AsRef<Path>) {}
fn send_network(x: impl AsRef<[u8]>) {}

// Further analysis needed. In these cases the function wants
// ownership of some `String` or `Vec<u8>`. If those are
// "low freqency, low volume" functions `AsRef` has better ergonomics,
// otherwise accepting a `String` or `Vec<u8>` will have better
// performance.
fn new_instance(x: impl AsRef<str>) -> HoldsString {}
fn send_to_other_thread(x: impl AsRef<[u8]>) {}
```

In contrast, **types** should generally not be infected by these bounds:

```rust,ignore
// Generally not ok. There might be exceptions for performance
// reasons, but those should not be user visible.
struct User<T: AsRef<str>> {
    name: T
}

// Better
struct User {
    name: String
}
```



## Accept `impl 'IO'` where feasible ('sans IO') (M-IMPL-IO) { #M-IMPL-IO }

<why>business logic untangled from I/O, with N*M composability.</why>

Functions and types that only need to perform one-shot I/O during initialization should be written "[sans-io](https://www.firezone.dev/blog/sans-io)",
and accept some `impl T`, where `T` is the appropriate I/O trait, effectively outsourcing I/O work to another type:

```rust,ignore
// Bad, caller must provide a File to parse the given data. If this
// data comes from the network, it'd have to be written to disk first.
fn parse_data(file: File) {}
```

```rust
// Much better, accepts
// - Files,
// - TcpStreams,
// - Stdin,
// - &[u8],
// - UnixStreams,
// ... and many more.
fn parse_data(data: impl std::io::Read) {}
```

Synchronous functions should use [`std::io::Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html) and
[`std::io::Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html). Asynchronous _functions_ targeting more than one runtime should use
[`futures::io::AsyncRead`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/io/trait.AsyncRead.html) and similar.
_Types_ that need to perform runtime-specific, continuous I/O should follow [M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED] instead.

[M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED]: ./#M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED



## Accept `impl RangeBounds<>` where feasible (M-IMPL-RANGEBOUNDS) { #M-IMPL-RANGEBOUNDS }

<why>flexibility and clarity when specifying ranges.</why>

Functions that accept a range of numbers must use a `Range` type or trait over hand-rolled parameters:

```rust,ignore
// Bad
fn select_range(low: usize, high: usize) {}
fn select_range(range: (usize, usize)) {}
```

In addition, functions that can work on arbitrary ranges, should accept `impl RangeBounds<T>` rather than `Range<T>`.

```rust
# use std::ops::{RangeBounds, Range};
// Callers must call with `select_range(1..3)`
fn select_range(r: Range<usize>) {}

// Callers may call as
//     select_any(1..3)
//     select_any(1..)
//     select_any(..)
fn select_any(r: impl RangeBounds<usize>) {}
```



## Types are Send (M-TYPES-SEND) { #M-TYPES-SEND }

<why>use in Tokio and behind runtime abstractions.</why>

Public types should be `Send` for compatibility reasons:

- All futures produced (explicitly or implicitly) must be `Send`
- Most other types should be `Send`, but there might be exceptions

### Futures

When declaring a future explicitly you should ensure it is, and remains, `Send`.

```rust
# use std::future::Future;
# use std::pin::Pin;
# use std::task::{Context, Poll};
#
struct Foo {}

impl Future for Foo {
    // Explicit implementation of `Future` for your type
    # type Output = ();
    #
    # fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, _: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<<Self as Future>::Output> { todo!() }
}

// You should assert your type is `Send`
const fn assert_send<T: Send>() {}
const _: () = assert_send::<Foo>();
```

When returning futures implicitly through `async` method calls, you should make sure these are `Send` too.
You do not have to test every single method, but you should at least validate your main entry points.

```rust,edition2021
async fn foo() { }

// TODO: We want this as a macro as well
fn assert_send<T: Send>(_: T) {}
_ = assert_send(foo());
```

### Regular Types

Most regular types should be `Send`, as they otherwise infect futures turning them `!Send` if held across `.await` points.

```rust,edition2021
# use std::rc::Rc;
# async fn read_file(x: &str) {}
#
async fn foo() {
    let rc = Rc::new(123);      // <-- Holding this across an .await point prevents
    read_file("foo.txt").await; //     the future from being `Send`.
    dbg!(rc);
}
```

That said, if the default use of your type is _instantaneous_, and there is no reason for it to be otherwise held across `.await` boundaries, it may be `!Send`.

```rust,edition2021
# use std::rc::Rc;
# struct Telemetry; impl Telemetry { fn ping(&self, _: u32) {} }
# fn telemetry() -> Telemetry  { Telemetry }
# async fn read_file(x: &str) {}
#
async fn foo() {
    // Here a hypothetical instance Telemetry is summoned
    // and used ad-hoc. It may be ok for Telemetry to be !Send.
    telemetry().ping(0);
    read_file("foo.txt").await;
    telemetry().ping(1);
}
```
